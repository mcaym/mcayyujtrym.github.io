		<p id='text'> Sandover Village is the environment where the 
		the first adventure of the dynamic duo began. This place is harnesed by the Sage of Green Eco, Samos. This form of eco represents the health of the people
		in-game.This village is believed to have been built by the precursors, who could be Jak's ancestry. Sandover Village consists of one primary collection of huts, four islets, and two beaches. Samos' hut lies on the southernmost side of the village, resting on an islet held up by a rock plateau. That islet then connects to an intermediate islet by a wooden bridge, which draws a bridge to the central part of the village that contains three huts and a docking station for the Fisherman's speedboat. The village is located in front of the entrance to a massive jungle, and at the bottom of a grassy mountain with canyons of lava on top. It neighbors Sentinel Beach, which is located by following a wood bridge ahead of the Sculptor's hut. Sandover Village is a tropical environment with sandy beaches, palm trees, and grassy cliffs. It consists of stone-made huts, stone and wooden decor, and minimal establishments. It derives its power from a source of blue eco in Forbidden Jungle, which is routed using towers to the Mayor's hut.  Sandover Village is actually in the heart of Haven City. </p>
