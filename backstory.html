		<p id='bgtext'> In a world built by the precursors but nearly extinct from precursor elements 
					  , we see heroes try to maintain the history and respect for the creators, while
					  others would use whats left of the main elements to life for their own benefit and destroy. One of these elemnents is the precursor stone, which one is left available in the world. Kor is determined to crack the stone open, and let a precursor come out of it in order for him to gain control and change the world as he sees fit, while <a id=jakpage href="Jak.html"> Jak </a> and   <a id=daxpage href="daxter.html"> Daxter </a> are trying to get this stone out of the dangerous hands of Kor. <br> Jak however, is not ready to fight Kor yet as he needs and element of green eco, aka the eco of life. This eco is purchasable by a trade for 10 Precursor Orbs, the rarest currency of the world of Jak and Daxter at the moment. Help Jak collect the orbs that he needs in order for him to face Kor and preserve the Precursor stone.  </p>
